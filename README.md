# 🧠 Mental Health Detection Using DistilBERT & Explainable AI (LIME)

This project is a robust mental health analysis tool that uses two fine-tuned DistilBERT models to detect **mental health disorders** and their possible **root causes** from Reddit-style posts. It includes **explainable AI** via LIME to provide users with transparency and interpretability into model decisions.

## 📌 Project Overview

The tool helps users analyze free-form text and receive:
- Predicted **mental health disorder** (e.g., depression, anxiety, lonely, suicidewatch, mentalhealth)
- Probable **root cause** of the issue (e.g., trauma and stress, personality, drug and alcohol, early life)
- **LIME explanations** for model decisions (with HTML visualization + download option)

### This project is built using:
- `Hugging Face Transformers` for NLP pipelines
- `Scikit-learn` for label encoding
- `LIME` for explainability
- `Gradio` for a beautiful, interactive UI

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
python app.py
```
Open your browser and navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:7860

## 📁 LIME Explanation
Once a post is analyzed:

-> LIME explanation will be shown inline

-> An HTML file (lime_explanation.html) will be created and available for download

-> You can open the file in any browser for a detailed token-level interpretation

## 🔍 Model Details
# 🧠 Model 1 – Disorder Detection
-> Fine-tuned DistilBERT model for classifying posts into mental disorders.

-> Trained on cleaned Reddit mental health text.

# 🔍 Model 2 – Root Cause Detection
-> Second DistilBERT model fine-tuned to identify the underlying cause.

-> Uses label encoding and decoding via label_encoder_root.pkl.

# ✨ Explainability (LIME)
-> Uses LimeTextExplainer from the lime package

-> Provides a local explanation showing top 5 contributing words per post
